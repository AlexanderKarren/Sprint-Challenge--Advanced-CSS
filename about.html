      <h2>About Our Plight</h2>
    
      <p>If anyone has seen Batman, Elon Musk is our Joker and Space X is our Arkham Asylum. Now that I think about it, that's a poor comparison since Arkham Asylum is a prison and not an evil corporation, but whatever.</p>
      <p>This is not a smear campaign against Musk – we are simply trying to expose him as the supervillain he is. We want to get to space and investigate his Space X satellites and extract and decrypt the documents housed within.</p>

          <p>It is our opinion that Elon Musk's first dangerous move was putting a car into space. What if it came back down and fell on somebody really important, like Barack Obama or Patrick Stewart? His second worrying career move was going onto the Joe Rogan experience. Joe Rogan is a known affiliate of Alex Jones, who we suspect is a vampire.</p>
